                obligations or covenants under these Terms; (3) your unlawful and/or unauthorized use of, or activities
                in connection with the Services including any Tracsia websites. The foregoing indemnities shall survive

            <p class="text-b">Assignment</p>
            <p class="paragraph-css">You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations
                hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Tracsia’s
                prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations
                without consent.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-b">Choice of Law</p>
            <p class="paragraph-css">Terms are governed by and will be construed under Thailand law, without regard to
                the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of
                these Terms (whether brought against Tracsia or against any director, officer or employee of Tracsia in
                their personal capacity) shall be finally settled in Thailand, in Thai language.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-b">Miscellaneous</p>
            <p class="paragraph-css">The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not
                be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
                unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary,
                so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Except where
                expressly agreed in writing otherwise, and except for our Privacy Policy, you and Tracsia agree that
                these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and
                Tracsia, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and
                other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree
                that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Tracsia, and you do not have any
                authority of any kind to bind Tracsia in any respect whatsoever. You and Tracsia agree there are no
                third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
